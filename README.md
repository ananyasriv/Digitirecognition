# Digitirecognition

The handwritten digit recognition is the capability of computer applications to recognize the human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different shapes and sizes. The handwritten digit recognition system is a way to tackle this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image. Artificial Neural Network model created over the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits
